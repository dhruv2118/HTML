    <!-- Assignment Question 1 -->
        <H2>Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</H2>
        <p>HTML Tags: The starting and ending point parts of an HTML document are HTML Tags, which start with &lt; less than and end with &gt;greater than angle bracket, <br>and whatever is written inside the angle brackets are known as tags.</p>
    <p>HTML Elements: In HTML, elements contain the material in the spaces between the tags. <br>An expression or a structure make up this. Its structure is composed of a start tag, content, and an ending tag.
</p>
<!-- Assignment Question 2 -->
<h2>What are tags and attributes in HTML? </h2>
<p>The structure and look of web pages are defined by tags and attributes in HTML. <br><br> In general, tags go around material and give information about the stuff they are around. <br><br> In contrast, attributes are used to add details about an element, such as its size, colour, or behaviour.

    of a constituent. For instance, input "b"type="text" /b> /b>"Enter your name" placeholder: b> /b>required</b>&gt; <br> The input> tag in this instance specifies an input element, while the attributes type, placeholder, and needed provide the input further context.</p>
    <!-- Assignment Question 3 -->

        <h2> What are Void Elements in HTML? </h2>
        <p>Elements without a closing tag and no content are referred to as void elements. They are also referred to as "Self Closing tags" or "Empty Elements."</p><br><br> EXAMPLE
        <ol>
        <li> &lt;img <b>src</b>="animal.jpg" <b>alt</b>="animal Image"&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;br&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;link&gt;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As can be seen, each of these elements just contains the start tag and no closing tag in this case. Even without the content, they are able to add the extra details to the website.</p>
        <!-- Assignment Question 4 -->
    
        <h2> What are HTML Entities? </h2>
        <p>Regardless of the browser or platform being used to view them, entities are employed to ensure that reserved characters are properly displayed on web pages. They are either characters or special codes. <br><br> They are expressed by a unique syntax consisting of an ampersand (&) symbol and a string of letters beginning with the letter "b."

            and the /b> semicolon. </p> <br> <br>
            <ol>
                <li> &#38;copy; &rightarrow; To display a copyright &copy; symbol</li>
                <li> &#38;nbsp; &rightarrow; To display non-breaking space</li>
                <li> &#38;quot; &rightarrow; To display double quote <b>""</b> symbol</li>
                <li> &#38;apos; &rightarrow; To display single quote <b>'</b> symbol</li>
            </ol>

            <h2> What are different type of Lists in HTML? </h2>
        <p> There are mainly 3 types of lists that can be used to organize and structure the content. <br>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong> Ordered List("&lt;ol&gt;") <u>or</u> Numbered List(NL): </strong></li>
                <p> &rightarrow; Ordered lists are used to present a list of items in a specific order or sequence. List styles
                    could be applied are <strong> 1, I, i, A, a </strong> <br><br> for ex.<br> &lt;ol <b>type</b>="A"

        <h2> What is the Class attribute in HTML? </h2>
        <p>The class property for an HTML element defines one or more class names.<br>
            Any HTML element can use the class attribute.<br>
            CSS and JavaScript can both use the class name to perform specific actions on items that have the specified class name.

            <!-- Assignment Question 7 -->
           <h2> What is the difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML elements? </h2>
        <p>The 'id' and 'class' attributes are both used to give particular names or identifiers to HTML components, although they serve different functions. 

            A single element can be uniquely identified using the 'id' attribute. The 'class' attribute, on the other hand, is used to group together a number of objects that have similar styles or behaviours. 
           
            for illustration, section class="sauce">........ section 
            [div class="photo"]..... <⁄div>
                       
           
            Here, (1) any element defined with the class(grouping)="sauce" in that section or any other element defined with the same class(grouping) outside of that section in a programme will accept all the styles and/or behaviours specified in CSS for that specific class. 
           (2) where the id="photo" is specified, it is a unique id and cannot be shared by any other element.</p>

            <h2> How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? </h2>
            <p>The characteristics 'cellpadding' and 'cellspacing' can be used to regulate the spacing between cells.

                within and between cells in an HTML table. <br><br> 'cellpadding' regulates the distance between a cell's content and a table's
    
                'Cellspacing' regulates the distance between neighbouring cells in a table, whereas 'border' controls the border.</p>

    <h2> What is the difference between a block level element and an inline element? </h2>
    <p>The main difference between block-level and inline elements is the <br>default width and height behavior and
        how they affect the layout of the content. block-level elements create a <br> new line and occupy the entire line

        <br> Tags Like  &lt;div&gt; , &lt;article&gt; , &lt;fieldset&gt;,&lt;h1&gt;.....&lt;h4 &gt; <br>
         <p>In contrast, inline elements do not create a new line, they just occupy the width
            necessary for its content.  </p><br>Example

            <h2>What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and XHTML stand for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language which
                    is a connection between HTML and XML(Extensible Markup Language).</li>
                <li>HTML is not case-sensitve so tags and attributes could be written in lower or upper case as needed, where as
                    XHTML is case-sensitive and strict with every tags and attributes written in the code should be lower case
                    only.</li>
                <li>HTML files can be stored with .htm,.html extensions; whereas XHTML can be stored with .xhtml,.xht or .xml
                    extensions.</li>
                <li>HTML can add attributes without any quote and in XHTML, it is mandatory to add quotes on every declared
                    attribute. </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h2> What are logical and physical tags in HTML? </h2>
            
            <p>There are 2 types of tags in HTML: <br>
            <ol>
                <li><u>Logical Tags:</u></li><br>
                <p> Logical tags are tags that describe the structure and meaning of the content, without specifying how it
                    should be displayed. <br><br>for ex. Heading tags(&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) ; Paragraph tag (&lt;p&gt;) ;
                    Table tag(&lt;table&gt;) and more... <br> These tags provide meaning to the content and help screen readers
                    to understand the content structure. </p>
                <li><u> Physical Tags: </u></li><br>
                <p> Physical tags are tags that describe how the content should be displayed on the screen.<br><br>for ex. Bold
                    and strong tag(&lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;) ; Underline tag (&lt;u&gt; or &lt;ins&gt;) and many more...
                    <br> These tags normally provide visual styling to the content.
                </p>
            </ol>
            </p>
